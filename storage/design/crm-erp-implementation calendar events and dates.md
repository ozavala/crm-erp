## 1\. Analysis and design of architecture

- **Review the current structure** to understand how OwnerCompany, customers, contacts, and CRMUsers are modeled. This is key to correctly defining new entities and relationships.
- **Define the new entities** :
    - **Appointment (Appointment/Date):** Entity to store information about scheduled meetings or events, linked to OwnerCompany, Customer/contact and CRM user.
    - **Task:** Pending, assigned to CrmUsers and related to ccustomes/contacts and OwnerCompany.
    - **Calendar:** By incorporating the Spatie\\Laravel-Google-Calendar package
- Consider essential fields in each entity such as start and end date/time, duration, status (pending, completed), description, priority, and participant data (users, customers).

## 2\. Data model and relationships

- Expand the database schema to include tables for tasks and appointments.
- Each one must **have a clear relationship with OwnerCompany** , and reference to customers, contacts and CrmUsers, to ensure data segregation by company and CRM context.
- Design foreign keys to maintain referential integrity and enable efficient queries.

## 3\. Backend: API and business logic

- Create or extend RESTful APIs to manage:
    - Create, edit, delete appointments and tasks.
    - View appointments and tasks by OwnerCompany, customer, user, and date range.
- Implement logic for automatic/manual appointment assignment to users.
- Implement notifications, alerts, or reminders for upcoming appointments or pending tasks (optional for advanced version).

## 4\. Frontend: user interface

- Add modules or screens for:
    - **Visual Calendar:** Display appointments and tasks in day, week, and month views (for reference)
    - Forms for creating and editing appointments and tasks linked to customers/contacts.
    - Task lists with filters by status, crmuser, and customer.
    - Integrate visual and email alerts and notifications (if supported by the system).

## 5\. Integration and synchronization

- Integrate with Google Calendar for two-way sync
- Evaluate automations to avoid repetitive tasks or scheduling conflicts.

## 6\. Testing and validation

- Perform unit and integration tests on the backend and frontend.
- Validate correct relationship and restriction by OwnerCompany for privacy and security.
- Test different scenarios with multiple users, customers, and contacts.

## 7\. Documentation

- Document technical design, API usage, and end-user guides.
- Create short tutorials for using the calendar, creating appointments, and managing tasks.

## Good practices as well as ideas for implementation:

- **Visual task and calendar management:** monthly, weekly, and daily views, navigation between periods, and task creation by clicking on the date.
- **Appointments assigned to users and clients:** assignment based on availability and Round Robin algorithm for load balancing (example in Odoo ERP module for online appointments).
- **Integration with external tools and notifications:** Improves internal and client collaboration and avoids scheduling conflicts.
- **Isolation and segmentation by OwnerCompany:** essential for multi-company and security, it must be reflected in both the database and business logic.
