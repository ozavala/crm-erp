## Create a Kanban Interface

**Implement Kanban Design** \
Design for the administration, configuration, and feature access menus to provide a dynamic, organized, and modern visual experience for the application. Streamlining navigation and improving task and access management and prioritization for administrators and operational users.

## Specific Suggestions 1. Kanban Board Structure for Menus

Create Kanban columns representing action categories or application areas:

- **Administration**
- **Configuration**
- **Reports**
- **Main tasks**
- **Quick Access**

Each card within a column represents a specific module, menu, or action.

## 2\. Professional Cards

Each card must include:

- Identifier icon
- Short name and optional description
- Number of pending notifications or status
- Shortcut button
- Quick action options (edit, move, filter)

Visual example (schematic):

| Administration | Configuration | Functions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Users | Preferences | Tasks |
| Roles and Perm. | Integrations | Calendar |
| Audit | API Keys | Information |

## 3\. Usability and Personalization

- **Drag & Drop:** Allows the user to rearrange cards based on priority or frequent use.
- **Card Shortcuts:** Add mini buttons for recurring tasks (create new, view history, edit config).
- **Search and Filters:** Includes a search bar to quickly locate options among Kanban cards.
- **Responsiveness:** The design should adapt to different screens, ensuring good viewing on desktop and mobile.

## 4\. Technical Implementation

Framework to build an interactive and professional board, 
- Integrates with Livewire/Vue.js creating fluid animations and real-time updates.
- Apply WIP (“Work In Progress”) limitations to prevent too many tasks/configurations from accumulating in one column, improving usability.

## 5\. Kanban menu design best practices

- **Visualize the complete flow:** All key areas of the system should be represented on the dashboard for easy context and quick access.
- **Category and color:** Use colors or labels to differentiate access types (critical, frequent, settings, etc.).
- **Explicit Policies:** Document and explain the function of each column or card so that any user knows how to navigate the system.
- **Visual feedback:** Integrates clear feedback (drag, drop, clicks) and highlights changes made by the user.

## Recommendations

- Analyze users needs and actual flow to define Kanban categories.
- Don't overload the cards: choose essential information and iconography.
- Conduct usability tests and adjust positioning and grouping based on user feedback.
- Maintain a consistent aesthetic with the rest of the system: icons, color palette, and typography.

The goal is to achieve an intuitive and professional administrative and configuration menu, capable of scaling and adapting to future system needs.
